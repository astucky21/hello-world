# hello-world
My first repository!

My name is Alex, and I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I recently discovered that I love web development, and have started committing fully in studying HTML, CSS, and Javascript to enhance my skills in this type of work. I've been loving it so far; I've studied several different coding languages in the past, and these 3 together I feel are clicking better than others I've tried learning. I also know a bit of VBA and SQL from my current line of work. Speaking of that; I currently work for Walmart E-Commerce as what's called a "Specialist in Business Analytics and Insight". Sounds fancier than it actually is, but I enjoy it for now. That being said, my main goal is getting a web development job.
